# Bauman-Oates Project

## Overview
The Bauman-Oates project encompasses multiple initiatives, with a primary focus on the Great White Shark Sighting Tracker, an application for tracking shark sightings along the Wallace, California coast. Additionally, it includes an Emergency SOS system for Apple Watch and a potential therapeutic model. This repository contains architectural diagrams, timelines, implementation code, and related documentation.

## Key Components
- **Great White Shark Sighting Tracker**: A cross-platform system (iOS and Desktop) for tracking shark sightings, featuring map integration, geofence alerts, and LLM-generated summaries.
- **Emergency SOS for Apple Watch**: Implementation in Swift for an SOS feature, supported by architectural diagrams.
- **Therapeutic Model**: A YAML file suggesting a therapeutic model, version 3.
- **Additional Documentation**: Various markdown files and diagrams providing context and planning details.

## Repository Structure
- `/docs` - Documentation files including project goals, timeline, and analysis documents
- `/shark-tracker` - Files related to the shark tracking application
- `/emergency-sos` - Implementation and architecture for the Emergency SOS system
- `/therapeutic-model` - The therapeutic model YAML file and related documents
- `/config` - Configuration files including git configuration and project setup
- `.goose` - Configuration directory for Goose AI interactions

## Key Files
- `shark-tracker/shark-tracker-build-architecture.svg` - Architectural diagram for the shark tracker
- `shark-tracker/shark-tracker-timeline.md` - Detailed timeline documentation for shark tracker development
- `emergency-sos/swift-emergency-sos-implementation.swift` - Swift code for an emergency SOS feature on Apple Watch
- `emergency-sos/watchkit-sos-architecture.svg` - Architectural diagram for the WatchKit SOS feature
- `therapeutic-model/therapeutic_model_v3.yaml` - YAML file for a therapeutic model
- `docs/Projecttimeline.pdf` - A PDF outlining the project timeline

## Getting Started
To contribute or understand the project:
1. Review the architectural diagrams in the respective directories for an overview of the systems.
2. Read through the markdown files in the `docs` and `shark-tracker` directories for detailed planning and timelines.
3. Examine the Swift code in the `emergency-sos` directory for implementation details on the SOS feature.
